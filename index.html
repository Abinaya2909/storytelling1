                    <p style="text-align:justify;">One children were at play in their play-ground one
                        day, when a herald rode through the town, blowing a trumpet, and crying aloud, “The King! the King passes by this road to-day. Make ready for the King!”</p>
                    <p>The children stopped their play, and looked at one another.</p>
                    <p>
                        “Did you hear that?” they said. “The King is coming. He may look over the wall and see our playground; who knows? We must put it in order.”
                    </p>
                    <p>They waited all day for the coming of the King, but he never came; only, towards sunset, a man with travel-worn clothes, and a kind, tired face passed along the road, and stopped to look over the wall.</p>
                    <p>“What a pleasant place!” said the man. “May I come in and rest, dear children?”</p>
                    <p>“It is our playground!” they said. “We made it pretty for the King, but he did not come, and now we mean to keep it so for ourselves.”</p>
                    <p>“That is good!” said the man.</p>
                    <p>The story proper concerns a fierce, protracted battle at the fortress of Dineirth where a hopelessly outnumbered troop of Celtic warriors under the command of King Maelgun (symbolized by the red dragon).</p>
                    <p>It is attacked by a horde of Saxon invaders led by King Cynurig and the heroic Beowulf--both of whom perish in the fray, by sword and fire respectively.</p>

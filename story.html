        <p>One children were at play in their play-ground one
            day, when a herald rode through the town, blowing a trumpet, and crying aloud, “The King! the King passes by this road to-day. Make ready for the King!”</p>
        <p>The children stopped their play, and looked at one another.</p>
        <p>
            “Did you hear that?” they said. “The King is coming. He may look over the wall and see our playground; who knows? We must put it in order.”
        </p>
        <p>They waited all day for the coming of the King, but he never came; only, towards sunset, a man with travel-worn clothes, and a kind, tired face passed along the road, and stopped to look over the wall.</p>
        <p>“What a pleasant place!” said the man. “May I come in and rest, dear children?”</p>
        <p>“It is our playground!” they said. “We made it pretty for the King, but he did not come, and now we mean to keep it so for ourselves.”</p>
        <p>“That is good!” said the man.</p>
